<!-- TODO: Add pipeline title -->

### Introduction

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. 
It comes with docker / singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

The current workflow is based on the nf-core best practice. See the nf-core project from details on [guidelines](https://nf-co.re/).
